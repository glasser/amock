To be done by Monday:

4/16: Find a good plugin framework which is non-reflective,
interface-based, and has a variety of tested plugins.

4/23: Use the plugin framework to give me more failing test cases to
work on fixing, and integrate tests on the plugin framework into my
build system.

4/30: Actually attempt to fix the issues identified above.  I expect
there to be many and for this to be a long task, but make identifiable
progress on that this week...

5/7: And more of the same this week.

5/14: Re-evaluate work so far; find more failing tests and fix them.

5/21 (start of finals week): Given what I know so far about the
project and its successes and failures, come up with an outline for my
thesis.

5/28 (vacation): No work this week (previous week will be spent on
6.170 grading and then I am taking some vacation).

6/4: Attempt an alpha "release" of amock which works on some
non-trivial set of inputs.  (TODO: define what I mean by "release".)

6/11: Continue making small tweaks to the implementation; start doing
more serious experiments (multiple-version-of-plugin fault detection,
etc) and writing sections of the thesis that can be written now
(background, etc).
